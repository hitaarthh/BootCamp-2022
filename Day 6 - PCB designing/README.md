## Introduction: 

- Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are the foundational building block of most modern electronic devices.  Whether simple single layered boards used in your garage door opener, to the six layer board in your smart watch, to a 60 layer, very high density and high-speed circuit boards used in super computers and servers, printed circuit boards are the foundation on which all of the other electronic components are assembled onto.

- Semiconductors, connectors, resistors, diodes, capacitors and radio devices are mounted to, and “talk” to one another through the PCB.


- PCBs can be single-layer for simple electronic devices. Printed circuit boards for complex hardware, such as computer graphics cards and motherboards, may have up to twelve layers. PCBs are most often green but they can come in any color.

#### <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCAD</a> software is used in PCB designing.

## Task assigned:

1) Design a double layered PCB with a minimum 1 via.
2) Add your own custom silkscreen on behind the PCB.
3) Upload the .sch and .pcb files in the gitlab.
