- Wireless Network provides various comfort to end users but actually they are very complex in their working. There are many protocols and technologies working behind to provide a stable connection to users. Data packets traveling through wire provide a sense of security to users as data traveling through wire probably not heard by eavesdroppers.

- This is where we come in and resarch on the possible loop holes and cracks one can use inorder to exploit these Wireless networks and devices.

- Softwares such as [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and [URH](https://github.com/jopohl/urh)software to capture and transmit radio signals.

## Task assigned:

1) Make a GNURadio flowgraph that takes an audio input from your sound card and maps its frequency domain representation.
2) Make 2 GNU Radio flow-graphs implementing an AM Receiver and Transmitter and test its working. You can refer to the GNU Radio wiki for necessary details
3) Make a writeup explaining the concept of an IQ signal. Refer to the GNU Radio wiki.
