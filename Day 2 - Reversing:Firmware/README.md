<div align="center"><h1>Reverse Engineering</h1></div>

- The session started off with what reverse engineering is all about, so bascially 

***Reverse-engineering is the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. It is done primarily to analyze and gain knowledge about the way something works but often is used to duplicate or enhance the object.***

- This domain deals reverse engineering the firmware on an IOT device in order to exploit/dicover vulnerabilities in an IOT device.

- IOT devices usually work on languages like C/C++ hence these codes can be converted into Assembly Code and see how the entire firmware works on it.  

### What exactly is Assembly Language?

- An assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computerâ€™s hardware. Unlike machine language, which consists of binary and hexadecimal characters, assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans.

- Assembly Code depicts how exactly a code is running on firmware and how much space it is taking in the register/cache memory.
