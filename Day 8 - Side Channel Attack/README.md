## Introduction:

- A side-channel attack (SCA) is a security exploit that attempts to extract secrets from a chip or a system. This can be achieved by measuring or analyzing various physical parameters. 

- Examples include supply current, execution time, and electromagnetic emission. These attacks pose a serious threat to modules that integrate cryptographic systems. Indeed, many side-channel analysis techniques have proven successful in breaking an algorithmically robust cryptographic operation and extracting the secret key.

## How does a side channel attack work?

- A side-channel attack does not target a program or its code directly. Rather, a side-channel attack attempts to gather information or influence the program execution of a system by measuring or exploiting indirect effects of the system or its hardware. Put simply, a side channel attack breaks cryptography by exploiting information inadvertently leaked by a system. 

- One such example is van Eck phreaking attack, which is also known as a Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard (TEMPEST). This attack monitors the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation emitted by a computer screen to view information before it is encrypted.

## Use of Proxmark Sensor in SDA's: 

- The Proxmark is an RFID swiss-army tool, allowing for both high and low level interactions with the vast majority of RFID tags and systems world-wide.
