### Introduction:
- ICS are command and control networks and systems designed to support industrial processes.
- The largest subgroup of ICS is SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.
- ICS have passed through a significant transformation from proprietary, isolated systems to open architectures and standard technologies highly interconnected with other corporate networks and the Internet. 
- Today ICS products are mostly based on standard embedded systems platforms, applied in various devices, such as routers or cable modems, and they often use commercial off-the shelf software.

- All this has resulted in reduction of costs, ease of use and enabled the remote control and monitoring from various locations. However, an important drawback derived from the connection to intranets and communication networks, is the increased vulnerability to computer network-based attacks.
As above mentioned due to automation of alot of things in the industry there is a high risk of things being attacked/exploited, this is where we come in and research on different vulnerabilities in an ICS system, and provide possible solutions to prevent such attacks and exploitations.

### How exactly this domain functions ?

- These industrial circuit model basically work on devices like <a href="https://www.amci.com/industrial-automation-resources/plc-automation-tutorials/what-plc/">PLC's</a> and <a href="https://realpars.com/rtu/">RTU's</a> which are more of a programmable devices which coordinate there actions to run an automated industrial network.

## Tasks assigned:

Install the software provided in the <a href="https://www.hackers-arise.com/post/2016/10/31/SCADA-Hacking-Modbus-MasterSlave-Simulation">link</a> and play around with PLCs and nodes and get the idea how master to slave relation works.
