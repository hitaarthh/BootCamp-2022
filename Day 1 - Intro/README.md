## Introduction to IOT Devices:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction

## Difference between Microcontrollers and Microprocessors:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Microprocessors</th>
    <th>Microcontrollerss</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is only a processor, so memory and I/O components need to be connected externally</td>
    <td>Micro Controller has a processor along with internal memory and I/O components.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>A Microprocessor requires an Operating System to work on</td>
    <td>A Microcontroller does not requires an Operating System to work on</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Memory and I/O has to be connected externally, so the circuit becomes large.</td>
    <td>Memory and I/O are already present, and the internal circuit is small.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Microprocessor is the heart of Computer system.</td>
    <td>Micro Controller is the heart of an embedded system.</td>

### Arduino UNO 3:

- [Arduino UNO REV3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware) Arduino Uno REV 3 is an Arduino board based on the microcontroller ATmega328P. It carries 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs. Moreover, 6 analog input pins are available on the board and the clock frequency is 16MHz. Arduino UNO is one of the most used boards from the Arduino family.

- The UNO board is the first USB board from the Arduino family. Arduino is an open-source platform which means you can get a hold of Arduino boards and software and edit and modify them as per your requirements.

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) is a open source free software used to program and control Arduino UNO 3.
